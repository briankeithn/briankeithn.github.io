This grant is funded by ANID (*Agencia Nacional de Investigaci√≥n y Desarrollo*) and the full title is **Interactive Narrative Analytics: Developing scalable knowledge-based narrative extraction models and visual analytics systems for sensemaking in complex information landscapes**.

## Summary
This project aims to advance the state-of-the-art in computational narrative extraction and interactive analytics to support sensemaking from large, complex collections of news articles. The rapid proliferation of online news and the increasing prevalence of misinformation and disinformation have made it ever more challenging and important for analysts and the public to make sense of the news landscape. Building on the PI's prior work on narrative maps and a theoretical foundation in narrative extraction and interactive visual analytics, this project will develop novel knowledge-informed models and scalable computational architectures to extract and interactively visualize the key entities, events, and storylines across large news corpora.
